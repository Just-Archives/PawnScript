# Third-party API
- An application programming interface; or API in short; is a way for two or more computer programs to communicate with each other. It is a type of software interface, offering a service to other pieces of software. In PawnScript, you can import a built-in API module containing its own `@`-marked components, such as `samp`, `mysql` and such.
