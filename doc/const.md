# Constants
- In computer programming, a constant is a value that should not be altered by the program during normal execution, i.e., the value is constant.

- You also may make constants in PawnScript:

```cpp
const[int]MY_FIRST_CONST=1
```


You also may create boolean and string constants:

```cpp
const[bool]MY_FIRST_CONST=true

const[str]MY_FIRST_CONST="string"
```

## Data types

### `int`

- Integers are whole numbers.

```cpp
const[int]integer=27
```

### `bool`

- Booleans are variables that can either be true or false.

```cpp
const[bool]boolean=false
```

### `str`

- Strings are words or sequences of characters.

```cpp
const[str]string="Some text"
```

### `double`

- Doubles are numbers with decimal points.

```cpp
const[double]decimal=45.3
```

### `char`
